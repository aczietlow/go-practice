# Warmup Projects

These are meant to really familiarize yourself with the language and programming in general


## Rules

- Turn off code completion, LSP, and copilot
  - In Jetbrains: `settings > Editor > General > Code Completion ... [ ] Enable as you type`
- Use the golang official docs and std package libraries
- My golang notebook
